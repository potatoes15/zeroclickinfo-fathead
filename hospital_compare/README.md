## Fathead plugin for Medicare Hospital Compare data

### About

Medicare tracks quality, safety, and patient satisfaction data about
US Hospitals. It reports the data on
[http://www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov/](http://www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov/).

This plugin grabs that data and displays some of it as zero-click
info.

Specifically, it shows 1 tiny, but important piece of the data: What
percent of patients would DEFINITELY recommend this hospital to
others?

### Notes

This is my first DDG plugin. Help and advice appreciated!
